### Chapter 7:  Entity-Relationship Model

#### Modelling

* A data base can be modeled as
  * a collection of **entities**
  * relationship among **entities**
* **Entity**
  * a distinguishable object
  * have **attributes**
  * **entity set**
* **Relationship**: an association among several entities
* **Relationship set**: $\{(e_1,\ldots,e_n)|e_1\in E_1,\ldots e_n\in E_n\}$, $E_k$ are entity sets and each $(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$ is a relationship
  * may have an **attribute**, e.g. *instructor* and *student* may have the attribute *date* 
  * **Degree**: most **binary**
* **Attributes**
  * Domain
  * Type
    * Single / composite
    * Single-valued / multivalued
    * Derived (can be computed from others)
* **Mapping Cardinality Constraints**
  * One to one
  * One to many
  * Many to one
  * Many to many 
* **Keys**: super key, candidate key, primary key
* Redundant attributes

#### E-R Diagrams

* **Rectangle**: entity set
  * Attributes list inside the rectangle
  * Underline: primary key
* **Diamond**: relationship set
* Composite attribute: components list after with indent
* Multivalued attribute: add \{\}: e.g. *{phone_number}*
* Derived attribute: append (): e.g. *age( )*
* Relationship set with attributes: **dashed** line linking a rectangle with the diamond
* **Roles**: Each occurrence of an entity set plays a “role” in the relationship
  e.g. relationship *prereq*(*course_id*, *prereq_id*), *course_id*, *prereq_id* are roles
* **Cardinality Constraints**
  * One to one: $\leftrightarrow$
  * One to many: $\leftarrow$
  * Many to one: $\to$
  * Many to many: $-$
* **Total participation**(**double** line): every entity in the entity set participates in at least one relationship in the relationship set, e.g. *section*
  * Partial participation: some entities may not participate, e.g. *instructor* in *advisor*
* **Ternary relationship**: more than binary relationship

#### ER design

* **weak entity set**: has not primary key
  * depends on **identifying entity set**
  * **identifying  relationship**: **double** diamond
  * **discriminator (or partial key)**: set of attributes to distinguish, noted by **dashed** underline
  * primary key of weak entity set = partial key + primary key of strong entity set (dependent)
* **Reduction to Relation Schemas**
  * A strong entity set reduces to a schema with the same attributes
  * A weak entity set becomes a table that includes a column for the primary key of the identifying strong entity set
  * A many-to-many relationship set is represented as a schema with attributes for the primary keys of the two participating entity sets, and any descriptive attributes of the relationship set
* **Redundancy of Schemas**
  * Many-to-one and one-to-many relationship sets that are total on the many-side can be represented by adding an extra attribute to the “many” side, containing the primary key of the “one” side
  * For one-to-one relationship sets, either side can be chosen to act as the “many” side
* Composite attributes: for each component
* A multivalued attribute M of an entity E is represented by a separate schema EM

#### Extended ER Features

* **Specialization**
  * Top-down design
  * Attribute inheritance 
* **Generalization**
  * Bottom-up design
  * superclass-subclass relationship
* **Aggregation**
* **Representing Specialization via Schemas**
  1. Form a schema for the higher-level entity, form a schema for each lower-level entity set, include primary key of higher-level entity set and local attributes
  2. Form a schema for each entity set with all local and inherited attributes
* **Representing Aggregation via Schemas**
  * primary key of the aggregated relationship
  * the primary key of the associated entity set
  * any descriptive attributes
